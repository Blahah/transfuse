  Transfuse v#{Transrate::VERSION::STRING.dup}
  by Richard Smith-Unna <rds45@cam.ac.uk> and
     Chris Boursnell <cmb211@cam.ac.uk>

  DESCRIPTION:
  Merge multiple assemblies.

  USAGE:
  transfuse <options>

  OPTIONS:

  EOS
  opt :assembly, "assembly file(s) in FASTA format, comma-separated",
      :type => String
  opt :left, "left reads file in FASTQ format",
      :type => String
  opt :right, "right reads file in FASTQ format",
      :type => String
end

transfuse = Transfuse.new

# concatenate assemblies into one fasta file
cat = transfuse.concatenate opts.assembly
# run transrate on new file with left and right reads
bam = transfuse.transrate(cat, left, right)
# keep the final output bam file from transrate

# run corset on this bam file
output = transfuse.corset(bam)
# for each cluster pull out sequences and get the score for each

# in each sub cluster throw away the sequence with the lowest transrate score

# profit!
